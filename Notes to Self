Notes to self:

Add a reward for letting cars that have been waiting so that the algorithm doesn't let cars sit for ages.
  Options include (but are obviously not limited to):
  - Having cars remove fitness from Light Systems based on how long they have been waiting
  - Adding a reward to letting a given car through based on how long it has been waiting
  - Decreasing the reward gained from a given lane based on how many cars have gone through that lane. (This applies over the entire process)
  - Decreasing the reward gained from a given lane based on how many cars have gone through that lane since changing lights/lanes. (This does not apply over the entire process)
